# Virtual Room Target
Here lies work to construct target response for virtual rooms in headphone speaker virtualization. Basis for the new
target is Harman room target which is then modified to include the preferred frequency response changes for headphones
demonstrated in Harman over-ear headphone target or in other words Harman over-ear target minus Harman's flat
loudspeaker in  response.

It is still unclear if the Harman room target already contains the slight warm tilt of from the difference or not. But
one clear difference is the 2.5 dB reduction at 3 kHz.

Light version of the virtual room target doesn't include the boost below 1 kHz.
